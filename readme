1. Installations
This project was developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project include:
•	tensorflow
•	numpy
•	pandas
•	matplotlib
•	os
•	sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)

2. Project Motivation
This project is focused on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The primary objective is to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance accuracy and efficiency in image recognition tasks.
The dataset used consists of 10,000 images, with 8,000 for training and 2,000 for testing. The model is designed to learn the features of the images through multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.

3. File Descriptions
This project contains the following key files:
•	CNN_for_Image_Classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the CNN implementation and results.

4. Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 82% on the test set after 10 epochs of training. Detailed findings and visualizations of the model's predictions can be found in the full report on Medium :
